- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with non-technical users in mind.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Offers clear results for easy understanding.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Compatible with various operating systems.

## ⚙️ How it Works

xssrecon works by injecting a test payload into the URL parameters you provide. It then observes how the application reacts to these inputs:

- **Allowed:** The input is accepted without any changes.
- **Blocked:** The input is rejected, indicating security measures are in place.
- **Converted:** The input is altered, which may indicate how the application processes special characters.

### 📊 Results Interpretation

Once the testing is complete, you will receive a report outlining your findings. This report will help you understand the security posture of your URL and determine what actions, if any, are needed.
